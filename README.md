# Credit Risk Classification
This project highlights the following technical skills:
* Data Manipulation
* Machine Learning
* Data Sampling Techniques
* Exploratory Data Analysis
* Model Evaluation
* Version Control

## Objective
The objective of this analysis was to predict whether a loan will be healthy or high-risk. The dataset was imbalanced, with a larger number of healthy loans compared to high-risk ones. To address this, two machine learning models were developed using different sampling techniques: random sampling and random oversampling.

### Data
Dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company.
Data were accessed accessed November 01, 2023. Data for this dataset was generated by edX Boot Camps LLC. 

The data provided included the following variables:
  * loan_size: The size of the loan.
  * interest_rate: The interest rate on the loan.
  * borrower_income: Income of the borrower.
  * debt_to_income: Debt-to-income ratio of the borrower.
  * num_of_accounts: Number of accounts the borrower has.
  * derogatory_marks: Number of derogatory marks on the borrower's credit report.
  * total_debt: Total debt of the borrower.

### Technologies Used
* Numpy
* Python
* Sk Learn
* Pandas

**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** The logistic regression model is effective in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans, with particularly strong performance in identifying healthy loans. There is room for improvement in precision for high-risk loans, suggesting potential areas of refinement for the model to enhance its accuracy in identifying high-risk loan cases.

**Question:** How well does the logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data, predict both the `0` (healthy loan) and `1` (high-risk loan) labels?

**Answer:** Considering the provided information about logistic regression model, fit with oversampled data:

* **Precision for Healthy Loans:** 100% (implying all predicted healthy loans are indeed healthy loans)
* **Recall for Healthy Loans:** 99% (indicating the model captures 99% of actual healthy loans)
* **Precision for High-Risk Loans:** 84% (meaning 84% of predicted high-risk loans are accurate)
* **Recall for High-Risk Loans:** 99% (implying the model captures 99% of actual high-risk loans)

Based on these results, the logistic regression model with oversampled data performs exceptionally well for both healthy and high-risk loans. It demonstrates high precision and recall for both classes, indicating its effectiveness in predicting both healthy and high-risk loans accurately.
